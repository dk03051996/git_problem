Make sure to commit your code first before doing anything
then add the file in .gitignore for ex: *.yml or main or .env 
then perform this command



git rm -rf --cached .
git add .
it will show that filed written in .gitignore is deleted
then commit the code by writing
sudo git commit -m ".gitignore is working fine"
then .giginore will work properly
